Objective:
To create two child processes, one for 'pfind' (executable provided - not written by @kaiqichee), and one for 'sort'. Connect the standard output of 'pfind' to the standard input of 'sort' using one pipe, then connect a second pipe to the standard output of 'sort', which the parent process will read from. The parent process will read from the read-end of the 'sort' pipe until it reaches end-of-file (read() returns 0), print out all the text received, AND report how many lines were returned.
