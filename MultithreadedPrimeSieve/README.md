Objective:
Implement the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers having two or more digits that are ‘3’. Unlike the standard sieve of Eratosthenes, that operates over the range [2, b], the segmented version can start at an arbitrary lower bound a, working over the range [a, b]. Since a wide range of values can be programmed in segments, this algorithm lends itself nicely to a multithreaded approach.
