Objective:
The goal is to write a basic shell program in C with a few built-in commands. This shell must implement color printing, cd and exit commands as built-ins, signal handling, and fork/exec for all other commands.
This program will involve making a shell. The main loop of this function should print the current working directory in blue, then wait for user input. When the user input has been entered, the program should act accordingly.
The program will be called from the command line and will take no arguments. ($ ./minishell)
