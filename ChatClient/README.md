Objective:
This assignment requires you to work with the sockets API in the C programming language to create a chat client that is able to communicate with a server. The client will send messages to the server, which is then able to broadcast the message to all the other clients on the system. Similarly, the client will be able to receive messages directly from the server, thus enabling the user to read messages sent by all other clients on the system.
